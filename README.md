===============

 This repository stores the code for my site: [http://palakmathur.in](http://palakmathur.in).
 After blogging on various platforms like blogger, live journal, wordpress, 
 and tumblr, I wanted to do my own code for my blog. I was frustrated with 
 them as I wanted to tweak them my way. So, I was thinking to just write html 
 pages for my blog posts and publish them. 

 Then I came to know about static website generators like Jekyll, Hyde and Pelican. 
 I was interested in Pelican as it was written in Python as I am learning Python these 
 days. And at the same time I wanted to control it through Git and Github Pages. However, 
 with limited time to install all the stuff that it needed, I went for Jekyll and yes, I 
 am loving it.
