title: [App Review] Epistle - A Simple Notes App for Android.
summary: Epistle is a light-weight note taking android app. This is my review of the application
---

For quiet sometime now, I was searching for an app which is lightweight, has clean interface, is functional and the one that could support markdown. That searchcame to an end with Epistle. Epistle has all the features that I listed above. It is light, has a great interface which is clean and functional. It helps me sync my notes with Dropbox, which is a feature I had been looking for. Syncing is neat and fast and the notes are accessible on your devices as soon as you have completed the note. It supports html preview of Markdown documents. 

I had tried using Evernote. But it was an overkill for my use. I like the simplicity of the app which fits well with my Android phone and with Dropbox sync, I can rest assured that my notes are safe and can be accessed from all my Dropbox synced devices. 

I also tried the Notes taking app that comes with Samsung Galaxy S2. But I did not like it for reasons that I could not sync the notes automatically with Dropbox. 

Epistle requires minimal permission and that too to access the internet so that it may sync your notes with Dropbox. Other than that it do not need any other permissions. 

I think for people who have minimal requirements and appreciate simplicity, Epistle is a good app.

My Rating: 4/5
