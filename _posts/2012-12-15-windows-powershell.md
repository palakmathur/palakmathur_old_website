Recently, I was going through some course on Internet when I came across PowerShell. We used to work with a program called cmd.exe, but always wanted to have the usability and power that Unix command line offers. If you are using Windows 7 or later, then you just need to follow following steps:-

- Click Start.
- In "Search programs and files", type: powershell and press Enter.

This will open a cmd.exe like window. You can try the following commands on powershell:

- **pwd** <br>
    print working directory
- **hostname** <br>
     my computer's network name
- **mkdir** <br>
     make directory
- **cd** <br>
     change directory
- **ls** <br>
     list directory
- **rmdir** <br>
     remove directory
- **pushd** <br>
     push directory
- **popd** <br>
     pop directory
- **cp** <br>
     copy a file or directory
- **robocopy** <br>
     robust copy
- **mv** <br>
     move a file or directory
- **more** <br>
     page through a file
- **type** <br>
     print the whole file
- **forfiles** <br>
     run a command on lots of files
- **dir -r** <br>
     find files
- **select-string** <br>
     find things inside files
- **help** <br>
     read a manual page
- **helpctr** <br>
     find what man page is appropriate
- **echo** <br>
     print some arguments
- **set** <br>
     export/set a new environment variable
- **exit** <br>
     exit the shell
- **runas** <br>
     DANGER! become super user root DANGER!
- **attrib** <br>
     change permission modifiers
- **iCACLS** <br>
     change ownership 

I am still trying to learn these commands. Will come up with details when I know about each of them. There are few that you already know. So, let us get started.

Enjoy Powershell!!
