    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am a Senior Software Engineer working with Capital One Auto Financial Services' Technology Division. And first thing first, the views expressed on this website and the articles herein or any of my linked blogs are personal my own and no way show and/or bear any linkages to my employer. </p>

     I mostly develop in Java, specially Spring and related projects, e.g., Spring XD, etc. Python is my preferred scripting language. However, I never used Python for any large scale enterprise project. I don't feel the need to switch from Java as far as the web platform is concerned as it does almost everything. I have had concerned with the tooling available for Java. However, with advent of Maven, most of my issues are resolved. I have used Apache Ant before. Due to lack of tooling, I used to like it but in hindsight that was cumbersome. Maven defined project structure for Java is ideal for almost all cases.

     I currently have three machines - a Macbook Pro with Retina Display, 13" 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, second Macbook Pro with Retina Display, 15", 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, and a HP ZBook with Windows 7, 512GB SSD, 32GB RAM. The first one is my personal machine and the latter two are office provided machines. I do my personal work, like editing this website, etc. on my personal Macbook. I have previously used IBM Thinkpad W500, IBM Thinkpad R400 dual bootable with Windows XP and Fedora OS. Now, I personally prefer Macbooks for their design and ease of use. I somehow think Windows has lost the charm it used have at least for Developer environments. My previous company, IBM, I heard is also moving away from Thinkpads to Macbooks and I think it is wise to switch to Macbooks as you get almost a Linux-like terminal and file system. Not as great but manageable. Add to this the Gestures and other features provided by MBP and no one can beat it.

     I have used Eclipse for most part of my life. However, I lately switched to Intellij IDEA and can proudly say that it was the wisest decision ever. Intellij makes your life much simpler. For the naysayers and Eclipse lovers, I would just say, try Intellij IDEA at least for a month with open mind. You would start loving it. There is an open source Community edition available if you want to try it out. I use Ultimate Edition for work, which comes with extra-features helpful for my needs and requirements as a developer. My employer has paid for my license fee.

    I have tried many editors and have eventually turned to Emacs for some solace. As I learn, doing stuff on Emacs, I am also learning Emacs LISP. That is a good thing as I love Clojure, LISP dialect for the JVM. For in-terminal editing I use Nano. I prefer Emacs in full-swing GUI rather than in-terminal. I have customized Emacs for Mac pleasure and I can use almost the same keys that I use for other programs on Mac. However, I prefer to avoid that by discipline rather than a rule. I use tools to make my life easier and not tough. As much as I would love doing things Emacs-way, I would also like to make my life simple and for that reason I am ready to take my own sweat time in learning Emacs-way.

   I use Brew as package manager for Mac. Suggestions for better package manager with reasons are welcome. On Windows, I prefer using Powershell. I have tried using Chocolatey as package manager for Windows and would say it is pretty nice but in very nascent stage. Powershell is really nice and I hope that it becomes the preferred Terminal on Windows and CMD program is retired. I don't know what happened to other <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/xp-downloads#2TC=powertoys">PowerToys</a>.

   I like watching series/movies/documentaries on Netflix and cable TV. I liked Departures a lot.  Murder She Wrote and Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries are the series that I am currently watching and loving. My son likes Chug Chug (Thomas Train series) and so do I. He likes to watch Kung Fu Panda Holiday, and refers to Panda as Cheetah and I love that. I love the movie too - a 20 minutes refreshing tale.
