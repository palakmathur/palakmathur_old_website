===============

 This repository stores the code for my site: [http://palakmathur.in](http://palakmathur.in). 
 After blogging on various platforms like blogger, live journal, wordpress, and tumblr, I wanted to do my own code for 
 my blog. I was frustrated with them as I wanted to tweak them my way. So, I was thinking to just write html pages for my blog posts and publish them.
